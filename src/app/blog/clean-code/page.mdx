In this article, we will explore various techniques and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code in React. Writing clean code is essential for ensuring that your codebase remains manageable and easy to understand, especially as it grows in complexity.

One key principle to keep in mind is to keep your components small and focused on a single responsibility. This makes them easier to test and reuse, and helps to avoid the pitfalls of large, monolithic components that can become difficult to maintain.

Another important aspect is to use meaningful names for your variables, functions, and components. This helps to make your code self-documenting and easier for others (and yourself) to understand when you come back to it later.

Additionally, it's crucial to handle state management in a way that keeps your components as stateless as possible. This can be achieved by using hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` wisely, and by leveraging context and other state management libraries such as Redux when appropriate.

By following these guidelines and continuously refactoring your code, you can ensure that your React applications remain clean, performant, and maintainable over time.

## Code Snippet

<CodeWindow title="BoxesContainer.tsx">

```TSX

    "--blue-300",
    "--indigo-300",
    "--violet-300",
